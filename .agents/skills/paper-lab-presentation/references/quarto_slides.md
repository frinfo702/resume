# Quarto Slides Reference

## When to Use

- Use Quarto when asked to create slide decks from an outline or notes.
- Prefer Quarto .qmd when the user already uses Quarto or wants reproducible slides.

## Minimal Quarto Slide Deck (Revealjs)

```yaml
---
title: "Talk Title"
author: "Author Name"
format:
  revealjs:
    slide-number: true
    theme: simple
---
```

## Slide Structure

- Every slide title must use `#` (h1). `##` or deeper headings are NOT recognized as slide titles in Quarto Revealjs.
- `---` can separate slides without titles, but titled slides always use `#`.
- Keep one message per slide.
- Use short bullets and a single figure per slide when possible.

## Example Skeleton

```markdown
---
title: "Paper Title"
author: "Presenter"
format:
  revealjs:
    slide-number: true
    theme: simple
---

# One-line takeaway

## Notes and Speaker Script

- Keep notes concise and aligned with the slide goal

## Figures

- Reference local images in `fig/` or `assets/` and keep filenames short.
- Always explain what the figure shows and the takeaway.
- Image syntax is `![caption](path)`. The text inside `[]` becomes the actual caption displayed on the slide. Use it to describe what the figure shows.
- When a slide contains one image, Quarto auto-applies the "content with caption" layout. In this layout, the image **must come last** in the slide. Text before image works; image before text breaks rendering.

```markdown
# Good Example

- This figure shows the model architecture.

```

```markdown
# Bad Example (rendering breaks)

- This figure shows the model architecture.
